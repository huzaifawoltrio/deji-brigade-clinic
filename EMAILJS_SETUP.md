   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the Contact page (`/contact`)
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. Check your email inbox for the test message

5. Navigate to the Referrals page (`/referrals`)
6. Fill out and submit the form
7. Check your email inbox for the test referral

## Important Notes

### Email Delivery
- **Free Plan Limits:** EmailJS free plan allows 200 emails per month
- **Spam Filters:** Make sure to check your spam folder for test emails
- **Email Address:** All emails will be sent to `intake@brigadephysicians.com` as configured

### File Attachments (Referral Form)
- **Note:** EmailJS doesn't support file attachments directly
- The file upload field is currently present but files won't be sent via email
- To enable file uploads, you would need to:
  1. Use a file storage service (Cloudinary, AWS S3, etc.)
  2. Upload the file to the storage service
  3. Include the file URL in the email

### Security
- Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control
- The `.env.example` file is provided as a template
- Keep your EmailJS credentials secure

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending
1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify your EmailJS service is active
3. Check the browser console for error messages
4. Ensure your email service is properly connected in EmailJS dashboard

### Template Variables Not Working
1. Make sure variable names in templates match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Use double curly braces: `{{variable_name}}`
3. Test templates in the EmailJS dashboard

### Rate Limiting
- If you hit the 200 emails/month limit, consider upgrading to a paid plan
- Or implement a backend solution with your own SMTP server
